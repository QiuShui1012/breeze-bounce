## Planned Features
***
*subject to change*

- Velcro Armour
  - Player can 'stick' to blocks when shifting

- Inflation Machine
  - Can keep blocks 'inflated' within a radius
  - Uses Wind Charges as 'fuel'

- Bounce Block Improvements
  - Double Bounce (almost working)
    - When a player falls more than 2.4 blocks and is shifting when they land, they block below and
      within 1 block will be 'inflated'
    - 2.4 blocks allows the player to double bounce on and only on the initial jump from
      a Bounce block
    - Similar to how you would double bounce your friends on a trampoline
  - Improve Collision Detection
    - I have ideas but no more brain power

- Planned Config Options
  - Bounce Block
    - Ticks ‘inflated’
    - Base Bounce Power
    - Terminal Velocity
    - Double Jump Spread
    - Double Jump Activation Threshold

***Note:*** All planned features are subject to change. I wish they were complete for V1.0.0, but they
are outside my ability for now. I will implement them after Modfest with more time and learning!

***Known Bugs***
- Some Funky collisions in corners with AbstractBreezeBlocks
